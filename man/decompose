NAME
  decompose - templating framework to help developers easily create and switch
  environments
SYNOPSIS
  decompose [--init <git_url>|--update|--build|--version|--help]
  decompose process [args..]
DESCRIPTION
  decompose is a templating framework to help developers easily create and
  switch environments. decompose provides development environment templates,
  custom variables and commands.

  How to use decompose: 
  Initialize  Normal usage of decompose is to first either initialize the
    development environment with the [--init] command
  Commands and templates  After the decompose environment is initalized,
    elements and processes will be available. This means that the build command
    [--build] will work to convert .mo template files into a file without a .mo
    extension and placeholder variables completed. Also, processes can be viewed
    from the help command [--help] as well as run using 'decompose process'
    syntax.
  Building environments   decompose enviornments are consist of a skeleton of
    the project, located in the 'skel' directory, elements located in the
    'elements' file, and processes defined in the 'processes' file.
OPTIONS
  There are no options. Only commands starting with '--' or processes from the
  environment. Processes can have their own arguments and options as defined in
  the 'processes' file.
EXAMPLE
  Initialize the an example repository

      $ decompose --init https://github.com/dmp1ce/decompose-hello-world.git

  Update environment after it has changed

      $ decompose --update

  Update build all templates

      $ decompose --build

  Run 'hello_world' process defined in the 'processes' file in the
  'decompose-hello-world' example environment.

      $ decompose hello_world

  See any public decompose environment for an example of how to create
  environments such as https://github.com/dmp1ce/decompose-hello-world.git
